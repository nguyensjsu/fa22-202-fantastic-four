### Week 1

#### Tasks done this week

In this week, we initialized our first scrum standup meeting on Wednesday night. I took over the role of ensuring courage in my team. My goal is to encourage my teammates to try new ways of implementing design patterns into our source code. As for the code I contribute, I am in charge of designing new obstacles for the game.

#### Tasks planned for next week

- Since now I introduce new obstacles into the game, I want to have them present different behaviors so it becomes more challenging.

#### Blocker

- There are no major blocks for my coding, but I talked more with my teammates who are in charge of implementing the level system so that I could intergrade the different behaviors of the obstacle objects based on the difficulty(level) of the game in the current state. In this way, player will not feel bored even if they are good at the game.

## Week2

#### Tasks done this week

In this week, I am in charge of upgrading the enemies in our game. There are two different improvements needed currently. First, we need to reorganize the code and give parent class to different actors. This is to ensure the practise of design patterns later can be successfully carried out. Second, we need to add more features to enemy behaviors. This is to accomodate the new leveling system we implement in our game.

#### Tasks planned for next week

- Reorganize the enemy code of our game
- Implement extra behaviors for enemy actors in late game (high levels)

#### Blocker

- I need to actively talk with my team member that is in charge of designing the levels so that we can show different stages of the game smoothly. This has been noted in our meeting this week and discussed to have a general picture. In this week's developement I will be in touch with Yikang through instant messaging app.
