### Week 1

#### Tasks done this week

In this week, we initialized our first scrum standup meeting on Wednesday night. I took over the role of ensuring courage in my team. My goal is to encourage my teammates to try new ways of implementing design patterns into our source code. As for the code I contribute, I am in charge of designing new obstacles for the game.

#### Tasks planned for next week

- Since now I introduce new obstacles into the game, I want to have them present different behaviors so it becomes more challenging.

#### Blocker

- There are no major blocks for my coding, but I talked more with my teammates who are in charge of implementing the level system so that I could intergrade the different behaviors of the obstacle objects based on the difficulty(level) of the game in the current state. In this way, player will not feel bored even if they are good at the game.

#### XP Core Value: Courage

To improve courage of the team, I started multiple interesting idea that could bring up brainstorm possibilities. Including making a multiplayer mode for the game.

## Week2

#### Tasks done this week

In this week, I am in charge of upgrading the enemies in our game. There are two different improvements needed currently. First, we need to reorganize the code and give parent class to different actors. This is to ensure the practise of design patterns later can be successfully carried out. Second, we need to add more features to enemy behaviors. This is to accomodate the new leveling system we implement in our game.

#### Tasks planned for next week

- Reorganize the enemy code of our game
- Implement extra behaviors for enemy actors in late game (high levels)

#### Blocker

- I need to actively talk with my team member that is in charge of designing the levels so that we can show different stages of the game smoothly. This has been noted in our meeting this week and discussed to have a general picture. In this week's developement I will be in touch with Yikang through instant messaging app.

#### XP Core Value: Courage

To improve courage of the team, I demoed prototypes of my design that use many design pattern ideas from this class. In this way, I hope to encourage my teammates to not be afraid of using what we learned in class.

## Week3

#### Tasks done this week

In this week, I refactored the code from our source, and introduced screen transitions based on abstract factory and singleton design pattern. This idea comes from Starbucks project and works well for our project.

#### Tasks planned for next week

- use Composite pattern to create different glyphs, such as buttons and labels for our project.
- Try out other ideas we talked during scrum meeting, those that improves courage for teammates to speakout.

#### Blocker

- The base code is too spegatti! It's not anyone's fault, but it reduces productivity and discourage our work. Therefore, I sat down with the team to refactor some of the code that we all use, and then suggested some improvements for future.

#### XP Core Value: Courage

To improve courage of the team, I showcased some other ideas from Greenfoot online game base that seems to be able to integrade to our project. I really want to encourage my teammates to do some different staff, like for example giving player ability to customize their fighter. These designs take long time and may not be materialized, but only discussing about them is enough to promote the XP core value of Courage.

## Week4

#### Tasks done this week

In this week, I finalized my design on composite pattern and started finishing all the documentations for the project. I took on the task to make a lot of diagrams for Readme and I enjoyed it.

#### Tasks planned for next week

- Finish all documentations and get ready to present! A lot of diagram work ahead.

#### Blocker

- I need to learn about other teammates design on their part, so that I have a general idea on how to split the tasks about Readme. We were able to sit down and talk about what everyone did, and at the end I had a plan on what to do.

#### XP Core Value: Courage

For this week, I chellenged my teammates to work together and generate comprehensive diagrams for our design patterns. I hope to bring out everyone's courage to speak about their prefered way of designing the Readme document, and decide on how we will be able to achieve the documentation award for this class. I also encouraged my teammates to go for the Agile development award by recording a scrum meeting together, I have faith we can get extra credit if we can showcase a in person scrum meeting!
