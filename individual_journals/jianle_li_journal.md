    * The objective is to modify it such that the enemy will continue to be produced without changing to a new stage.
### Blocker

### XP Value: Communication
Establish communication channels via the components of our group's weekly meetings so that everyone may readily communicate their thoughts and difficulties. 
There was not a circumstance in which a member of the group keeps mute the whole time. 
Through the comments voiced by everyone, we have determined this project's primary objective. 
On top of this foundation code, we discussed a total of four distinct extra functions, as well as the overall implementation direction of each function and its compatibility with the functions of other members. 
By discussing what members know and admire about the four features, we were ultimately able to allocate these four functions to the four members of our team.
