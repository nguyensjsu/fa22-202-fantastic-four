### Week 1

#### What tasks did I work on / complete?

In this week, we initialized our first scrum standup meeting on Wednesday night. I took over the role of ensuring courage in my team. My goal is to encourage my teammates to try new ways of implementing design patterns into our source code. As for the code I contribute, I am in charge of designing new obstacles for the game.

#### What am I planning to work on next?

- Since now I introduce new obstacles into the game, I want to have them present different behaviors so it becomes more challenging.

#### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

- There are no major blocks for my coding, but I talked more with my teammates who are in charge of implementing the level system so that I could intergrade the different behaviors of the obstacle objects based on the difficulty(level) of the game in the current state. In this way, player will not feel bored even if they are good at the game.
