## Week 1

#### What tasks did I work on / complete?

- Added the first task in Kanban Board
- Initialized Journals and first Journal Report
- Setting up the project in the local environment

#### What am I planning to work on next?

- Design the logic of gaining EXP and level-up
- Design the logic of different ways of attack

#### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

- None

#### XP Core Value: Feedback

When we initialize our project, everyone is willing to receive others' feedback. For example, we have to schedule a meeting to discuss how to design and implement specific features, like how to deploy this project and who is responsible for which part where everyone is going to finish the corresponding part, then give feedback to others.



## Week2

#### What tasks did I work on / complete?

- Implemented the logic of gaining EXP and level-up
- Design the logic of left fighter laser and right fighter laser

#### What am I planning to work on next?

- Implement the function with a strategy design pattern

#### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

- None

#### XP Core Value: Feedback

In the EXP part, given the feedback of Ray, we don't have to implement another system of level. We can just use the score to represent the current level. In this way, the left laser and the right laser can be changed with the current score.

Based on the feedback of Ray, we plan to use the same strategy of laser level-up, so I must keep my code of laser level-up reusable.



## Week3

#### What tasks did I work on / complete?

- Implemented the logic of left fighter laser and right fighter laser
- Implemented the logic of different ways of attack
- Implemented strategy design pattern in left laser and right laser

#### What am I planning to work on next?

- Implement strategy design pattern in the main laser
- Add the different directions of the left laser and the right laser

#### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

- None

#### XP Core Value: Feedback

Based on the feedback from Yiyang, the straight direction of the laser is too boring. We can add different directions of the laser, which will bring more interest to the fighter.

- Added the different directions of the left laser and the right laser

#### What am I planning to work on next?

- Complete the documents of the project

#### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
